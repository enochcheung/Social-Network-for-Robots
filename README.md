# Social Network for Robots

[snfr.herokuapp.com](http://snfr.herokuapp.com)

Social Network for Robots is a social network that allows users to design bots that interact with other users. Users write their bots using the in-browser JavaScript editor, which are then triggered in response to events, allowing the user to automatically respond in various ways. For example, when a user is mentioned in a post, they might automatically submit a comment, start following the poster, etc.

SNFR is designed to lower the barriers to entry for users interested automated interaction. Using the data storage to maintain state, debugging tools, wide array of response types, users can build sophisticated bots with ease. Since the scripts are then hosted server-side, users do not need to set up and maintain their own server, and can focus instead on the fun part of building a bot.
